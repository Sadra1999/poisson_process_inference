# poisson_process_inference

Replicated algorithms proposed by Samo and Roberts (2014) and Adams et al. (2009b)

### Method code: These files do not include the experiment on real world data, just on synthetic data.
#### How to run: 

1. Navigate to folder `algorithm`
2. cd to the algorithm folder and then type `python train.py` to run method 1
3. Type `python train2.py` to run method 2.
